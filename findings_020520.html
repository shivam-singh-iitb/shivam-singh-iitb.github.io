				Ever wondered why people are so addicted to Instagram, Facebook, gaming, internet pornography, drugs, etc while reading, etc. puts them off? Its because of the fact that these help brain release a lot of <b>Dopamine</b> (the feel-good hormone). In our brain, Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter (i.e. it plays a critical role in the functioning of the central nervous system) and affects many of our behaviours like learning, motivation, and mood,etc. <br />Although Dopamine is good for our body in controlled levels, altered levels of it can cause a range of problems from Parkinson's Disease to the Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) (in case of ADD, decreased levels of Dopamine makes it hard for people to focus).<br />
				Once we get what we desire, dopamine secretion  stops and our brain tries to stimulate us to perform tasks that releases it. This leads to cycle of delusion whereby people find themselves chasing happines constantly, called the <i><b>"molecule of more"</b></i>.

			</table><br />
			<p> But <b>excessive activities</b> of such kind, would artificially overload our brain with stimulus resulting in <b>overtiming of the receptors that detect these chemicals to "DESENSITIZE"</b>, i.e., we need more of these chemicals to actually feel their presence.<br />
			Let us consider the case of an alcoholic and a non-alcoholic. The non-alcoholic will get drunk only by drinking a few bottles of beer. But the alcoholic would require much more rounds in order to get drunk as his receptors for getting drunk have began to see many bottles of drinks as "NORMAL".</p>
			<p>On the other hand, <b>deprivation</b> of this hormone also has detrimental effects to our body. It leads to anxiety, depression, stress, agitation and an overall lack of energy or motivation. When people stop engaging in addictive behaviours suddenly, they experience withdrawal symptoms and fallback to the destructive patterns of behaviour that makes them feel better.</p>
			<p>The <b>solution</b> to these problems is <b>"Dopamine Detox"</b>. In this simple procedure, we significantly reduce the amount of stimulating activities like binge-watching, drinking, social networking, etc. to form <b>"sensory depravation"</b>,i.e., we engage less in reward seeking behaviour. When people stop engaging in pleasure-stimulating activities, the receptors for these chemicals start becoming more sensitive again, i.e., <b>less is needed to get the same feeling</b>.</p>
			<p>The best way to detox is to cultivate the <i>"here and now"</i> transmitter, i.e. the neurotransmitters - serotonin, endorphins, oxytoxin and GABA. We can perform the following to reduce stimulating activities.</p>
			<h4>Ways to reduce Stimulating Activities : </h4>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Meditation</b> : It helps to increase dopamine levels naturally by help rebuilding our prefontal cortex.	
				</li><br/>
				<li><b>Self-Reward</b> : Save time for leisure by adding more hours to work. e.g., if we add 15 minutes of watching our favourite TV show at the end of the day, for every hour of hard work that we put in, we will be more productive. So, if a person works 8 hours a day, he/she would get atleast two hours daily, at the end of the kept aside to perform his/her engaging activities.</li><br />
				<li><b>Exercise</b> : It increases dopamine output of the brain.</li><br />
				<li><b>Music</b> : Soothing, relaxing and upbeat music are a wonderful dopamine enhancer.</li>

			<h3 id="afternoon">Afternoon Slump</h3>
			<h4> Defintion :</h4> 
			<p>The term <b>Afternoon Slump</b> refers to the sleepy and sluggish behaviour of feeling that comes in the afternoon, from around 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Many people experience a noticeable dip in their energy levels, alertness, and ability to concentrate in the afternoon.</p>

			<h4>Causes :</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Carbohydrate Heavy Lunch</b> : Many people tend to have carbohydrate heavy lunch, leading to what is known as <i>"sugar crash"</i>. Simple carbs (i.e. carbohydrates not made from whole grains) cause a rapid spike in blood sugar level, followed by a dramatic drop.</li><br/>
				<li><b>Dehydration</b> : Even mild dehydration can make one feel tired, fatigued and moody. Facts say that this can happen with as little as 1.5% loss of body's water content.</li><br/>
				<li><b>Insomnia and Sleep Deprivation</b> : People who do not complete their sleep cycle at night (7 - 9 hours) are more likely to get fatigued in the afternoon.</li><br/>
				<li><b>Release of Melatonin and Decrease in Cortisol Levels</b> : Post-lunch sleepiness can stem from a dip in the core body temperature and decrease in levels of cortisols (important component of alertness) that naturally occurs between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. It's a dip that triggers the release of a snooze-inducing hormone called Melatonin. It's a normal part of our bodies <b>circadidan rhythm</b>.</li><br/>
				<li><b>Stress</b> : It can deplete the brain of resources, leaving the body mentally and physically exhausted.</li><br />
				<li><b>Underlying Metabolic Disorders</b> : An underlying metabolic disorder such as insulin resistance, reactive hypoglycemia and polycystic ovarian syndrome, etc. can also lead to fatigueness in the afternoon hours.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Solutions :</h4>
			<p>Once the metabolic disorders are ruled out the following can be helpful in getting over Afternoon Fatigue.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Consume Proteins and less simple-Carbs at Lunch</b> : Choose lunch meals that contains high proteins and low fats and carbs. Fats and carbohydrates take a lot of resources to be absorbed. Proteins are easily digested and keeps the body energized for hours. Lunch can also combine fiber and complex-carbohydrates as they raise the blood sugar level and keeps them up.</li><br />
				<li><b>Drink plenty of Water</b> : Dehydration may lead to afternoon fatigue. Drinking ample water can be useful to avoid fatigue due to it.</li><br />
				<li><b>Sleep well at night</b> : Get plenty of sleep at night. Sleep-deprived people are more likely to struggle with fatigue in the afternoon.</li><br />
				<li><b>Sit under the Sun for 10 minutes</b> : Sunlight exposure for about 10-15 minutes reduces the amount of <b>melatonin</b> and boosts our vitamin D levels.</li>
				<li><b>Power Nap</b> : Although a sign of malpractice in work environments, a power nap of 10 - 20 minutes actually help restore the energy deficiency and reduce stress. Increase in nap-time leads to sleep inertia (the drowsiness that one experiences during transition of sleep to wakefulness ) , that again leads to fatigueness (Caution!!).</li><br />
				<li><b>Keep Busy</b> : Keep busy during these hours by doing some not-so-important works. This would allow you to do work as well as be less-active.</li><br />
				<li><b>Mental Stimulation</b> : Engage in mindful activities like meditation, or play some music that invigorates you, or do isometric exercises, etc.</li><br />
				<li><b>Take a walk, Socialize</b> : Take a stroll for 10 minutes. Walk up to your friend in the office, have some caffeine or tea, and talk about something other than work. Movement helps.</li>
